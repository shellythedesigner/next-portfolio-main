# Hi! I am Rafet ðŸ‘‹

My journey into the world of web development started with a curiosity for coding, and it has evolved into a commitment to mastering ReactJS. I am on a journey of constantly learning the technologies involved. Although my core stack is MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js, I like to add something to myself by learning new technologies in my spare time. I'm currently improving myself on Next.js and Typescript.
